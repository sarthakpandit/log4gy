If your really love my work, particularly if you use it all day long in your commercial works and earn money with it, you can thanks me by various ways :

  * Make a comment to thanks me !

  * Make a (small) donation to my paypal account to pay my server, or buy a cup of coffee (i need caffeine to survive xD).

  * Buy me a gift from my wishlist and send it @t

```
Mr Aur√©lien GY,

```

  * Or just send me a "thanks postcard" at the same address ! If i get a lot of them, i will take a picture and put it on my website :). Anyway, even if i get only one or two, i will always be glad to receive them.

Have fun,
Effy
